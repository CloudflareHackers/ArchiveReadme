<h2 align="center">Telegram Archive Bots</h2></center> 

<h3>First Of All What Was Happening With All The Bots In The Past Few Days Or Weeks?</h3>
Recently we migrated to new system of indexing and serving files. Cause old ways were costly and our services are mostly run free of cost and on donation. We do wanna provide files but not by paying the expense out of our pocket. The database cost of hosting using the old ways was going above thousand dollars. We can pay some small amount of our pocket but not thousands of dollars. So we migrated to a new method of indexing and serving files. In the past few weeks our main goal was to fix the bugs that were appearing , when we were migrating. Bugs were supposed to appear as this was a new way of doing things and it wasn't done by anybody else before this and there was no boilerplate for this as well. Everything was created by Bhadoo The owner of HashHacker channel. As we updated few things we started to feel that the whole process of getting files also needs to be simplified so that it becomes very easy for the user to use in the future. Also the threat of copyright strike is always on our head. So we also wanted to make this community private. The process of doing these things is almost complete now. Keep reading below , to get answere to all of your question. 
<br />
<h3>What Is This Profile System?</h3>
We have a implimented a new system of profile in order to go fully private after 31st may. When you create your telegram account , telegram assign a unique user id to your account, this can't be changed unless you delete your account. You can change your name, username and everything else in telegram account but user id is stay intact thorough all these changes. We are using to create a unique profile of you, it will help us serve our subscriber, and ban the abusers as well. We can maintain various permission thorough this. 
<br />
<h3>Can I Create A Profile Anytime?</h3>
Yes, you can create a profile any time you want till 31st may. After that we will not take any new user. We will only serve the user who have created their profile till then. Again all of our services will become fully private for our subscribers after 31st may. So if you wanna share the bots, now is the time.
<h3>How to create a profile or check if i have an profile?</h3>
You can start (send /start command) any of our archive bot (listed below) and that's it. If you are unsure whether you have created a profile or not or if your profile creation was succesfull , you can just send /profile command to any of our bot and it will show you whether a profile is created or not.
